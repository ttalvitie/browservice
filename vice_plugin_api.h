 *** Vice Plugin API Definition ***
 **********************************/

/* This file describes the common API for "vice plugins": shared libraries that can be used by an
 * interactive program to show its GUI to the user.
 *
 * The vice plugin API was originally designed as an abstraction of the user-facing part of the
 * Browservice web "proxy" server. Browservice makes it possible to browse the modern web on
 * obsolete operating systems and hardware by rendering the browser UI on the server side. The
 * plugin architecture makes it easy to add support for different types of clients to Browservice
 * while reusing most of the code.
 *
 * The API is not specific to Browservice, and thus the same plugins may be used for other kinds of
 * GUI programs as well.
 *
 * The GUI shown by the plugin consists of multiple windows; the program supplies the plugin with
 * updates to a resizable 24-bit RGB image view for each window, and the plugin sends the keyboard
 * and mouse events concerning the windows back to the program. In addition, passing clipboard text
 * and file downloads and uploads through the plugin is supported by the API.
 *
 * Typical API usage for API version 2000000:
 *
 *  1. The program verifies that the plugin supports API version 2000000 by calling
 *     vicePluginAPI_isAPIVersionSupported.
 *
 *  2. (optional) The program registers its logging and panicking functions to the plugin using
 *     vicePluginAPI_setGlobalLogCallback and vicePluginAPI_setGlobalPanicCallback, allowing the
 *     plugin to use them instead of its default logging and panicking behavior.
 *
 *  3. The program initializes a plugin context using vicePluginAPI_initContext, supplying it with
 *     configuration options (name-value-pairs). If the plugin is selectable by the user, then these
 *     configuration options should also be specified by the user, because the options are
 *     plugin-specific. The function may also return an error (for example if the configuration
 *     options are invalid); the program should show this error to the user. The program may query
 *     for the documentation of the options by calling vicePluginAPI_getOptionDocs.
 *
 *  4. The program starts the operation of the plugin context by calling vicePluginAPI_start,
 *     providing a VicePluginAPI_Callbacks structure that contains function pointers to callbacks to
 *     be called by the plugin. After this, the program and plugin communicate using function calls
 *     as follows:
 *
 *       - The program may call API functions directly; however, it must never make two API function
 *         calls concerning the same context concurrently.
 *
 *       - To avoid concurrency and reentrancy issues, the plugin context must not call callbacks
 *         directly from its background threads or API functions invoked by the program (except when
 *         specifically permitted by the documentation). Instead, it is synchronized to the program
 *         event loop as follows: The plugin notifies the program when it has events to process by
 *         calling the special eventNotify callback in any thread at any time. After a notification
 *         like this, the program should call vicePluginAPI_pumpEvents as soon as possible. The
 *         implementation of vicePluginAPI_pumpEvents may then advance the task queue of the plugin
 *         and call the callbacks provided by the program directly.
 *
 *     While the plugin context is running, the following kinds of things happen:
 *
 *       - The plugin opens and closes windows using the createWindow and closeWindow callbacks.
 *
 *       - The program opens popup windows from existing windows (if allowed by the plugin) and
 *         closes windows by calling vicePluginAPI_createPopupWindow and vicePluginAPI_closeWindow.
 *
 *       - The program supplies the window view image for each open window whenever the plugin
 *         requests it using the fetchWindowImage callback. The program notifies the plugin whenever
 *         the window image has changed by calling vicePluginAPI_notifyWindowViewChanged.
 *
 *       - The plugin sends various events to the program by calling callbacks, such as
 *           - window view resize requests with the resizeWindow callback,
 *           - input events using mouse*, key* and loseFocus callbacks.
 *         The program processes these events in an application-specific manner.
 *
 *       - Communication for other features, such as file uploads and downloads, mouse cursor
 *         updates, clipboard text, optional plugin navigation buttons and program widgets; see the
 *         function documentation comments for details.
 *
 *  5. To initiate the shutdown of the plugin context, the program must call vicePluginAPI_shutdown.
 *     When the plugin has shut down, it will respond by calling the shutdownComplete callback (in
 *     vicePluginAPI_pumpEvents). After this, the program and the plugin must immediately cease all
 *     communication for this context.
 *
 *  6. The program destroys the plugin context using vicePluginAPI_destroyContext.
 *
 * The API supports extensions; see the documentation for the function
 * vicePluginAPI_isExtensionSupported for more information.
 *
 * General API conventions and rules:
 *
 *   - The program and plugin communicate bidirectionally using function calls. The program directly
 *     calls the API functions of the plugin, and the plugin calls callback function pointers
 *     supplied by the program. In all its calls to the callback functions, the plugin passes a void
 *     data pointer supplied by the program as the first argument. The program may use this pointer
 *     to access its own data structures instead of using global variables.
 *
 *   - To avoid reentrancy issues,
 *
 *       * implementations of the plugin API functions may not directly call callbacks supplied by
 *         the program, and
 *
 *       * implementations of the callbacks may not directly call plugin API functions
 *
 *     except when specifically allowed by the documentation. To get around this restriction, a task
 *     queue should be used to defer the calls.
 *
 *   - No function in the API may retain and use pointers given to it as arguments after the
 *     function has returned, unless specifically allowed by the documentation. This applies to
 *     functions in the plugin API as well as callback functions given to the plugin through the
 *     API.
 *
 *   - Most of the API supports only a very simple form of error handling on the plugin side: either
 *     recovering from the error (and optionally logging a warning) or panicking and terminating the
 *     program.
 *
 *   - The strings passed through the API should typically be encoded as UTF-8; however, neither the
 *     plugin or the program should rely on this; instead, they should tolerate arbitrary
 *     null-terminated binary data, validating or sanitizing it if necessary. Non-user data passed
 *     through the API (such as error messages) should be mostly ASCII if possible in order to
 *     maximize compatibility.
 *
 *   - This API is not thread safe for concurrent calls concerning the same plugin context. However,
 *     calls concerning different contexts and calls not related to plugin contexts may be made from
 *     different threads concurrently.
 *
 *   - This API is asynchronous/non-blocking; API functions and callbacks should not block for I/O.
 *     All blocking should be done in background threads. As the API for a single context is
 *     synchronous, CPU-intensive operations (such as image compression) should also be offloaded to
 *     background threads to avoid stalling the whole program.
 *
 *   - This API is pure C; API functions and callbacks must not let C++ exceptions fall through to
 *     the caller.
